Recently Github started to force users to add 2FA, with the excuse that it's "for security".
But 2FA is a security risk, and more over, forcing users to add it, is like putting shackles on their neck and command they to obey.

But adding 2FA device just brings the risk of losing access to an account. Because if that device is broken or stolen, access is lost.

And most importantly. Blocking your account if you don't do a useless and harmful procedure is not the way to communicate with clients. Microsoft proved once again that they have 0 respect for their users and all they want is to control everything.

Today it's 2FA. Tomorrow it's KYC.
